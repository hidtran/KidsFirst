     What Makes Kids First Unique?
   </h4>
   <div class="faqDesc">

       <p>
       The Kids First curriculum was specifically designed for both parents and kids to attend, strengthening the kids emotionally and refocusing the parents on the needs of the kids.
     </p>
       <p>
       Kids First is a therapy based, interactive educational program utilizing peer group processes, providing both clinical and practical approaches to enhance parenting skills and reduce conflict.
       The parents' and kids' curriculums are coordinated in order to more effectively address issues affecting the family as a whole as well as those issues unique to each family member.
       </p>
       <p>
       At the conclusion of each weekly session, the clinical staff has a de-briefing where issues that arose in the parents' and kids' groups are discussed, providing insights for the following weeks.
       Kids First is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation serving the community since 1996, organized and managed by attorneys and therapists. It is the only program of its kind in Southern California.
